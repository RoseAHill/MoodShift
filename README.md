## About

The first step to controlling your mood is to know your mood. This is the foundation phrase for MoodShift and why MoodShift was created.

Life is a medley of positive and negative emotion; joy, stress, anxiety, excitement, fear, pleasure, wonder... the list goes on. This is all part of what makes us human. It's normal to feel caught up in all this. It's normal to be lost in your own head. It's fine to feel overwhelmed sometimes, or even most times. While it may be normal to have these feelings, the last thing anyone wants is to let emotions have control over your life.

As the Swiss psychiatrist and founder of analytical psychology wrote:

> "Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate."
> -Carl Gustav Jung

Self reflection is important, especially for those who find themselves being caught up in emotion. But I know first hand, that's easier said than done. That is why I decided to create MoodShift, a tracker for your daily moods and a journal for self reflection.
